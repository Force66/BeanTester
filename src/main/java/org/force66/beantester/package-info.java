/**
 * <p>Tests normal bean methods such as accessors, mutators, equals(), hashcode(), etc.  
 * If your organization has code coverage requirements, testing beans is some of the 
 * most monotonous work.  It's mindless and the less test code you need to write 
 * for this, the better.  BeanTester was written to get out of this monotonous work.  
 * Predecessors to it have been copy/pasted/improved into almost a dozen projects 
 * over the years.  </p>

 * <p>Documentation for the product can be found <a href="https://github.com/Force66/BeanTester">here</a>.</p>
